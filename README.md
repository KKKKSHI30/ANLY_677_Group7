##  Incorrect Facemask-Wearing Detection Algorithm Comparison
### Ke Shi, Yuquan Xu, Yixuan Cheng
The COVID-19 pandemic has wreaked havoc all over the planet. 
The pandemic has brought profound change to peopleâ€™s economic and social lives. 
During this global health crisis, numerous measures were enforced to fight off the adverse effects of this pandemic. 
Wearing facemasks has become one of the most influential and essential mechanisms governments adopt worldwide. 
The correct use of masks necessitates careful attention to general hygiene standards. 
The most important is adequate mouth and nose coverage while avoiding gaps between the face and the mask. 
However, a large number of people are reluctant to put on masks correctly, which poses a high risk for the transmission of infection. 
Thus, it is crucial to control the incorrect use of masks and guide people to wear masks correctly as they enter public spaces.
The primary purpose of our study is to compare the performance and accuracy of different methods proposed to distinguish whether a person is wearing a mask properly. 
We aim to determine which algorithm yields the highest accuracy to help determine the best practice to incorporate. 
Traditionally, face mask detection was applied to prevent terrorist attacks and reduce illegal 
and criminal conduct (Ejaz et al., 2019, Ge et al., 2017). Following the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers conducted several face mask occlusion studies (Su et al., 2021). 
VGG (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015), ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016), Alex (Krizhevsky, Sutskever & Hinton, 2012) and various classification systems were used to detect if the mask was worn correctly.
